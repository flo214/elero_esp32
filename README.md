# elero_esp32
Control elero/Nice/Griesser unidirectional shutters using the PCB out of a VarioTel2 and an ESP32

# Why?
Contrary to the bidirectional mode, there seems to be no open-source implementation of the Elero unidirectional protocol for older shutter receivers. The goal here is to enable the control of Elero/Nice/Griesser shutters with unidirectional receivers from Home Assistant.

# Requirements

# Hardware
You will need a varioTel 2 remote (or a Remoto 5 should work the same way)
